Priorities:
1. Document simulations in overleaf
2. Look at derivative of LL






Summary of simulations
	- Grid over sigmas $[0, 2\sigma_u^2]^2$, see what method results in less bias
	- Look at last email / correspondance doc
- Use least biases method on real data






Look at derivative of LL:
- Larry took the derivative of v'V^-1v, holding v constant. But v is the GLS regression errors, which are a function of the parameters.
- try to derive the derivative of v wrt parameters
