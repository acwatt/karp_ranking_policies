Bias in MLE:
- Mapped average bias from 100 simulated datasets at range of different sigma values. See output\simulation_plots\MLE_bias
- Appears that the starting value has a large impact on the bias.
- Need to use multistart -- could manually do it, just comparing the LL result from many places in the dist. 
- Is there an optim.jl way to multistart? Maybe https://github.com/tpapp/MultistartOptimization.jl
- Shortcut: calculate LL over grid and use max location as starting value of search
- How much does the value of rho impact the bias?


next:
- check boundaries on search -- is the lower boundary above the smallest point?
- compare algo's estimates against "true" maximums in data\temp\LL\LL_simulated_manualmax.csv for seeds 1-100
	- see mymle_2_testing_optim_algos() and myoptimize2()
- compare different methods (looks like the momentum gradient and conjugate gradient might be good)
- if close for some, need to test against different underlying sigmas (since seeds 1-100 are only based on sigma_base)

If algos aren't close to true maximums of LL functions:
- develop a multistart search algo and map the bias (need to define an appropriate search range)
	- could I assume sigma_a is zero, what would sigma_u be? Use that as center of search radius
	- Check grid of sigma's for LL value and use maximums as starting points (maybe 10x10 grid, and pick top 5 that aren't adjacent)

Research how to generate MLE SEs: 
- want to know what range of values rationalize the data...

Should I use a Hessian?
