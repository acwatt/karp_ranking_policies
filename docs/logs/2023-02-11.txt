Savio:
- Started a Savio account, waiting for Larry to approve

Bias in MLE:
- Mapped average bias from 100 simulated datasets at range of different sigma values. See output\simulation_plots\MLE_bias
- Appears that the starting value has a large impact on the bias.
- Need to use multistart -- could manually do it, just comparing the LL result from many places in the dist. 
- Is there an optim.jl way to multistart? Maybe https://github.com/tpapp/MultistartOptimization.jl
- Shortcut: calculate LL over grid and use max location as starting value of search
- How much does the value of rho impact the bias?


next:
- develop a multistart search algo and map the bias (need to define an appropriate search range)
	- could I assume sigma_a is zero, what would sigma_u be? Use that as center of search radius
