seed,random seed ( 1 through 10) to generate the data in a pseudo-random reproducible way.
type,"True = parameter values used to generate the data, Sample = sample variance of data, Estimated = estimated values from GLS/ML"
N,Number of regions
T,Number of time periods
b₀ᵢ,N-vector of region-specific fixed effects
β,"2-vector of time trend parameters (linear, quadratic)"
ρ,AR(1) process parameter
σₐ,sigma_alpha
σᵤ,sigma_mu
iterations,"number of iterations used in convergence to 10^-16 Frobenius norm of the covariance matrix. Maximum used was 10, which still result in <10^-11."
LL,Log Likelihood (initial and final)
V_norm_finalstep,Frobenius norm of the difference between the last two iterations of the covariance matrix.
V_norm_true,Frobenius norm of the difference between the last iteration of the covariance matrix and the “true” covariance matrix.
V,Place to save the “true” approximate numerical covariance matrix. Currently turned off because they are large.
