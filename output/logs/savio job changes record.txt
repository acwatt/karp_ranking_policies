Error: Pkg.precompile error
│   exception =

15201719 no instantiate in everywhere
	- no output? but failed to complete

15201727 added using SMTPClient to everywhere
	- SMTPClient error persists

15201730 added using SMTPClient to global scope
	- SMTPClient error persists

15202060 manual Pkg add of SMTPClient

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
15202087 Manually deleting all compilied folders in /global/home/users/aaronwatt/.julia/compiled/v1.9
	- after successful precompile and activation:
	ERROR: LoadError: On worker 18:
	`Turing=fce5fe82-541a-59a6-adf8-730c64b5f9a0` depends on `DynamicHMC=bbc10e6e-7c05-544b-b16e-64fede858acb`, 
	but no such entry exists in the manifest.
	- perhaps just need to make sure activation happens after any adding?
	- but looks like a Turing install issue
	- deleting the Project and Manefests

15202437 adding send_txt load to everwhere
	- same Turing LoadError

15202707 manually add package list instead of using Pkg.instantiate()
	- same Turing LoadError

15202745 including communications in global scope to allow texting out of the loop
	- same Turing LoadError

15202774 Manually deleted Project and Manefest in Utilities directory
	- LoadError: On worker 12:
	TypeError: in typeassert, expected Vector{Any}, got a value of type Dict{String, Any}

15202790 Added Turing to package adds
	- 2nd Turing LoadError
	LoadError: On worker 2:
	`Turing=fce5fe82-541a-59a6-adf8-730c64b5f9a0` depends on `Optim=429524aa-4258-5aef-a3af-852621145aeb`, but 
	no such entry exists in the manifest.

15202818 Separating activation, adding, loading of packages
	- same 2nd Turing LoadError

15202874 Adding Optim to manual package adds
	- same 2nd Turing LoadError

15203193 Adding env activation, installation, resolve, precompile in global scope before activation in distributed
	- same 2nd Turing LoadError

15203373 Manually remove env files during each script run.
	- LoadError: MethodError: no method matching String(::String, ::String)
15203455 Fixed string error
	- cancelled by SlurmClusterManager
	- nested task error: launch_timeout exceeded
	- the stacktrace says this line is the issue: addprocs(SlurmManager())
	
15203550 ran again because I thought it was cancelled by the BRC slurm manager
	- cancelled again by SlurmClusterManager

15203768 printing Pkg.status() to see which env is being used by Distributed, SlurmClusterManager
	- using github/karp_ranking_policies/ranking_policies/julia/KarpEstimation/Project.toml
	- this is the env set in savio3.sh
	- back to 1st Turing LoadError

15203984 Adding DynamicHMC to manual adds
	- Got further that before, but got a Turing error based on missing Bijectors precompile.

15204143 Adding Bijectors to manual adds
	- Failed to precompile Bijectors, then LoadError because it didn't finish precompiling Bijectors
	- remove precompile?

15204250 Commented out global precompile
	- file not found error in everywhere. May be caused by Pkg.status()

15204502 Remove Pkg.Status()
	- FileNotFound erorr for julia scratchspace -- machine specific info folder
	- seems that a worker (perhaps on the other node) is trying to read information from a folder on machine of the global env setup

15204841 Removing global resolve() in hopes of preventing machine specific info from being created
	- This works!

15204909 Replacing distributed instantiate with distributed add (maybe instantiate is trying to read from other node)
	- this brought back other errors. Don't directly add in everywhere!

15205087 Going back to just "no resolve() in global" + "activate + instantiate in everywhere"
	- This works!

15205189 Testing using communications in global to txt
	- LoadError: On worker 6: SystemError: opening file "/global/...Utilities/Manifest.toml"

15205201 test no hashbang
	- LoadError: On worker 36: SystemError: close: Stale file handle

15205238 test modifying dataframe from global scope
	- This works! I think there's some randomness due to the workers trying to access the same files.
	- may use try-catch loop?

15205316 adding try-catch for activating project
	- This works!


15205697 Trying karp estimation code (without estimation loop, just to see if everything else runs
	- Package SlurmClusterManager not found in current path.

15205738 add import Pkg; Pkg.add("SlurmClusterManager") at top
	- fixed the problem, but there was a different fileNotFound error during everywhere package install

15205779 add in small estimation loop
	- LoadError: On worker 12: SystemError: close: Stale file handle
	- think the try-catch loop should resolve this

15205839 add try-catch loop for package env instantiation
	- turing precompile error... hrmm, just happens every once in a while?

15205965 trying again...
	- errors happen before package instantiation
	- perhaps because I'm add("SlurmClusterManager") that forces a precompile
	- LoadError: SystemError: opening file "/global/.../Bijectors
	- LoadError: Failed to precompile Bijectors
	- final error during project activation: LoadError: Failed to precompile Turing

15205973 adding sleep before retry of env instantiation
	- LoadError: Failed to precompile Turing

15205999 adding limit to instantiation retries to avoid infinite loop
	- LoadError: Failed to precompile Turing

15206108 removed bash environment flag, deleted all in .julia/compiled/v1.9/
	- LoadError: Failed to precompile Turing 
15206115 copy

15206274 test script that loads SlurmClusterManager from base env and prints base env
	- just need to make sure to have SlurmClusterManager installed in .julia/environments/v1.9

15206304 removed initial add SlurmClusterManager that (I thought) was triggering early precompile
	- LoadError: Failed to precompile Turing  

15206481 deleted all in .julia/compiled/v1.9/
	- LoadError: Failed to precompile Turing  g  
	- originates in expression starting at /global/home/users/aaronwatt/.julia/packages/Turing/LcjVL/src/Turing.jl:1

15206487 @everywhere Pkg.activate(@__DIR__) before instantiating everywhere
15206591 copy, fixing Pkg not being defined
	- accidentally cancelled the job before I saw if it worked

15206730 deleted /global/home/users/aaronwatt/.julia/packages/Turing and Bijectors
	- LoadError: ArgumentError: Package NamedArrays
	- LoadError: Failed to precompile Turing
	- maybe it's because of the prior dependencies errors

15206859 Manually adding Turing dependencies, adding function defs to everywhere
	- some of the dependencies are not directly installable
	- TuringDynamicHMCExt and TuringOptimExt cannot be resolved

15206889 removed TuringDynamicHMCExt and TuringOptimExt installs
	- LoadError: ArgumentError: Package NamedArrays at top

15206893 Turing test in test1.jl
15206968 added NamedArrays dependency

increased size of estimation loop
